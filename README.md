### Hi I'm Afia, a full stack engineer based in Baltimore, MD. ✨👋

I cherish creativity, inclusion, and accessibility, and am most excited about projects where I can combine my love of the arts and technology with my passion for creating products that meaningfully impact users of all walks.  [Check out my portfolio](https://afiacaruso.com) 🥰

### 📚 Currently exploring: 
*Python 🐍, Liquid 💦 & React-Spring 🔩*

### 🛠️ Pet Project:
[BuddiGuide](https://github.com/afialydia/BuddiGuide) -- a web app designed to provide a resource for medical marijuana users to research and track their strain preference

### 🤞 2020 Goals: 
* *Develop something "enlightening" with the [Hue API](https://developers.meethue.com/) 💡* 
* *Find out what [waacking](https://youtu.be/h387rZ-tqc4?t=77) is all about 💃🏾 - it's a dance!*
